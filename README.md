#### Description:
Parabola is a cross-team project management software. It is geared towards the real estate industry for designers, developers, manufacturers, and contractors to receive and preview real-time updates that affect their project domain.

Since architecture school, I’ve practiced large-scale architecture for a total of 3 years, and one of the most frustrating aspects of the current design process is coordination across different companies. 

Construction industry projects are governed by a complex network of stakeholders (from architects to contractors), each critical to the project's success by performing shared tasks from installing electricity to concrete casting. Coordination between different parties can become incrementally trickier as the project size scales up. When the number of participants increases, the number of permutations increases for possible shared tasks. As it becomes harder to track these tasks, not everyone is notified when an update is approved for one party’s design decision due to the inefficiency of email and organized project calls. This leads to parties aggregating outdated designs. This ultimately slows down workflow velocity and causes pain to all parties in redundant work and revenue loss.

This affected all 7 projects I personally have been on, at different intensities, with two being extremely painful. Parabola aims to solve this.
